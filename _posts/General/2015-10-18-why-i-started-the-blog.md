Hi people , these are some of the reasons that made me start this
blog.  
  
<!--more-->
I'm relativly new to web development so:  
**- I love sharing stuff that i've learned about web development.**  
**- To write my thoughts about several topics and technologies that i have some experience in.**  
**- To be a better writer (_maybe write a book someday_ ðŸ˜‰).**  
**- To see that if i can actualy build a blog (âœ”).**
