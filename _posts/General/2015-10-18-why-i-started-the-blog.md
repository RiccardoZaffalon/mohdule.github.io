Hi people , these are some of the reasons that made me start this
blog.  
  
<!--excerpt-->

I'm relativly new to web development so:  
**- I love sharing stuff that i've learned about web development and linux.**   
**- To help people who want to go on them same journey i'm in.**  
**- To see that if i can actualy build a blog (âœ”).**
